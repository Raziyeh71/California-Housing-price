# California-Housing-price
In this project, we work with on housing.csv file from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).
This is the description of the steps:

The data cleaning is done by choosing the "median_house_value" feature as the target.
Using seaborn, the correlation of variables is examined.
The normal distribution of features: "total_rooms", "total_bedrooms", "population", and "households" is drowned.
The "Linear Regression" model applied to the train data.
The score of the model was not good, so the "RandomForestRegressor" model was tried.
Implemented "GridSearchCV", the best parameter of Random Forest is found.
The score of the "Random Forest" model is very good.
